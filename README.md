## Overview

morphosymm-rl is a reinforcement learning library for IsaacLab that extends the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) implementation of [RSL-RL](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/rsl_rl) with [Morphological Symmetries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15552]). This enables data augmentation of robotics systems, or directly embedding symmetry constraints through equivariant neural networks in the actor-critic structure. See the end of this README if you want to cite our work.


## Installation
Install this package with:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

For now, you need to install MorphoSymm and rsl-rl independently. Enter in their folders (they are submodules in this project) and do pip install -e .


## How to use
To use it, you just need first to change the usual rsl_rl_ppo_cfg.py file of your task in IsaacLab. Second, you need to use ad-hoc train.py and play.py files to launch your training/testing. See [here](https://github.com/iit-DLSLab/morphosymm-rl/tree/main/morphosymm_rl/example) for an example.
